# GRAPH.JS
A graphing engine that graphs any functional input, WITH zoom-in support. Will be updated to have a user friendly UI, and support more transcendental functions, as well as and complex inputs, derivatives, integrals, matrices, and 3-d graphs!


Disclaimer: This will eventually be ported to C and moved into my calculator app for graphing support!
