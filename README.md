# GRAPH.JS
A graphing engine that graphs and graphs inputted functions up to 3 dimensions, WITH zoom-in support. Will be updated to have a user friendly UI, and support more transcendental functions, as well as complex inputs, derivatives, integrals, and matrices


Disclaimer: This will eventually be ported to C and moved into my calculator app for graphing support!
