# GRAPH.JS
A graphing engine that graphs and graphs inputted functions up to 4 dimensions, WITH zoom-in support. Will be updated to have a user friendly UI, and support more transcendental functions, as well as complex inputs, derivatives, integrals, and matrices


Disclaimer: This will eventually be ported to C and moved into my calculator app for graphing support!

Aside:
This is a huge passion project for me, as I love linear algebra and calculus, and working on displaying higher dimensions in an intuitive way. Thank you for following me on this journey! I hope all who use it enjoy!
