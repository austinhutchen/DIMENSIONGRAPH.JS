# GRAPH.JS
A simple graphing engine that graphs any functional input. Will be updated to have a user friendly UI, and support more transcendental functions, as well as analytic continuations and complex inputs.


Disclaimer: This will eventually be ported to C and moved into my calculator app for graphing support!
